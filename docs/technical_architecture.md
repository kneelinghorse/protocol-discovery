Core Protocol Implementation Map
yamlSystem Name: "OSS Vitality Engine"
MVP Target: 4-week build → production on Railway

Protocol Stack:
  Primary:
    - Temporal: Contribution patterns, burnout cycles
    - Relational: Contributor dependency networks

]
Success Metrics for MVP

Accuracy: Correctly predict 3/5 projects showing risk signals

Adoption: 10+ projects request monitoring within first month

Next Steps with Claude Code
Mission 1: Data Collector
Create a Python service that:
1. Connects to GitHub API
2. Fetches commit, PR, and issue data for a given repo
3. Stores in PostgreSQL with proper time-series schema
4. Implements rate limiting and pagination
5. Sets up webhook listeners for real-time updates
Mission 2: Protocol Engines
Implement the three core analyzers:
1. TemporalAnalyzer with LSTM for pattern detection
2. RelationalAnalyzer with NetworkX for graph analysis  
3. SemanticAnalyzer with HuggingFace transformers
Mission 3: API & Dashboard
Build a FastAPI service with:
1. GraphQL endpoint for flexible queries
2. WebSocket for real-time alerts
3. Simple React dashboard showing health scores
